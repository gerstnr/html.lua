What:
-----
This VLC extension builds a playlist by scraping the input
web page for video links

Install:
--------

Put this script in your extensions directory:

* Linux: `~/.local/share/vlc/lua/playlist/`
* Windows: `C:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC/lua/playlist/`
* Mac: `/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/lua/playlist/`

Restart VLC.

Example:
--------

After installation, open this video test page:

http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody/test.html

in VLC and the video links on that page should be queued in
a new playlist.
